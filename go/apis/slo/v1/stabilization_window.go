// StabilizationWindow allows configuring the period of time that an elasticity strategy controller will
// wait after applying the strategy once, before applying it again (if the SLO is still violated), to
// avoid unnecessary scaling.
//
// For example, suppose that ScaleUpSeconds = 180 and a horizontal elasticity strategy scales out at time 't' due to an SLO violation.
// At time 't + 20 seconds' the SLO's evaluation still results in a violation, but the elasticity strategy does not scale again, because
// the stabilization window for scaling up/out has not yet passed. If the SLO evaluation at 't + 200 seconds' still results in a violation,
// the controller will scale again.
