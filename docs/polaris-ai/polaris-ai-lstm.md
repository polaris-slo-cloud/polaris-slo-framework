In this folder the files to run and train the LSTM model can be found.  
To re-train the LSTM, it is possible to run the script `gcd_single-job_multivariate_prediction.py [epochs neurons batch_size] --exp-name [exp]`.   
To reproduce the exact same model, the code is:`gcd_single-job_multivariate_prediction.py 400 50 72 --exp_name exp_01`.
